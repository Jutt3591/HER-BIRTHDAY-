  <h1>🌸 Happiest Birthday Meri Ayesha 🌸</h1>

  <!-- Message -->
  <div class="message">
There’s a girl in this world whose birthday falls on June 3rd, and for the rest of the world, that might just be a date. 🥱
But for me, it’s the day the most precious, most beautiful soul was born (Laal laal and polli polli Also 🤭) 🥹❤️

       🌸HAPPIEST BIRTHDAY MY LOVE🌸

You are my life, my beginning and my end, my first love and my last. 🥹
Every heartbeat I have, every breath I take, somehow carries your name. 🫵🏻

When I say You are important to me, I don’t just mean emotionally, I mean you are a part of my soul and my Life which belongs to Only you Alhamdulillah . 🥹💋
You are the reason I still believe in something pure and real. 🥹
You means more to me than anything else in this world Meri jaan 🫶🏼

You see, I’ve made many mistakes. 🫠
I’ve hurted you many times, and i feel the guilt of that every time. 😞
You gave me the love, Kindness, respect and everything . 🥹
And in return, I gave you pain many times, through my own faults and failures. 🫠
That’s something I’ll never forgive myself for. 🥹

But Meri jaan know this , I will never stop loving you. 🫶🏼
Not for one second, not through any hurdle or any misunderstanding or silence. 🥹 

When we had our first ever conversation on October 19th, 2023, it was so random 😭🙈
But that randomness became the root of the most meaningful and most beautiful part of my life Alhamdulillah. 🥹
Since that day, my heart has been tied to you in a way I can’t explain. 🫶🏼
You are the main story in my life. 🥹
You are the only reason I smile, the reason I stay standing even when I feel weak. 🫠

I love you like I’ve never loved anyone before.🌸
You are the girl I want to spend my life with, through every up and down. 🥹
You are not replaceable. Not forgettable. You are irreplaceable part in my Life. 🥹

You are like a mother to me😭🙈 not in role, but in my soul. 🫶🏼
When I’m around You , I feel complete. 🥹

That’s why it hurts so deeply when I remember the times I made you cry 🫠
You trusts me with your heart, and I didn’t protect it the way I should have. 🫠
I failed the one person I would give everything for. 🫠

Sorry 🫠

I wish I could go back in time and undo every wrong I do 🥹
I wish I could hold you close and stop the tears before they ever fell. 🫠
But time doesn’t work that way… and so all I can do now is try to Make you feel safe and Loved around me. 🥹

Because I want only you 🫵🏻,  In every life, every dream, every version of reality. 🌸
You are  not a choice I made once , you are the choice I will make every day, every moment,every second for the rest of my life. 🥹

Your smile is etched into my memory. Your voice is like a melody I can never forget. 🌸
You are the one I think of before I sleep, and the first thought in my mind when I wake. 🥹💋

I don’t want just memories, I want a future with You Meri Ayesha. 🥹❤️
I want to laugh with you, cry with you and grow old with you. 🫶🏼

I’ve learned from my mistakes, I can’t erase the past, but i will sure we will have a better tomorrow together InshaAllah. 🥹
Because all I want is a life with you, Just you and Only You 🫵🏻🥹

I think about you when I’m doing something by saying 1 mint jannu 😭😭 and Everytime I come late and say sollyyy 😓. 
You are everywhere, even in my quietest thoughts. 🥹
You live inside my soul like a soft whisper that never fades. 🌸

No matter what happens, no matter hoe much we are Naraz (Naraz di english nhi aundi😭) From each other  my heart belongs to you. 🥹
There’s no second thought, no doubt you are the first thought. 🙈
You are the only one I’ll wait for, fight for, cry for, and live for. 🫠

You didn’t just enter my life, You changed my boring and useless life with your Unconditional love 🥹
You were like the missing piece in my life, But Alhamdulillah alhamdulillah Allah Sent you to make My Life Complete. 🥹
And now I can’t remember what my life was like before you 🥹.

I miss you in such ways I can’t explain. 🥹
Sometimes it’s a quiet ache, sometimes it’s a storm in my chest. 😞
But When you are around, everything feels lighter, My pain becomes bearable because your presence is like an first aid to me. 🥹

I always think about the times I let you down.🫠
Regretting the words I said, the silence from me, that hurted you 🫠

Even after my mistakes, even after the cracks, I love you even more. 🥹
Because the pain i gave you reminds me of how much you matter in my Life. 🫠

I never want you to feel alone again. 🥹
I never want you to think you aren't loved, wanted, or enough. 🫠
You are My Everything And Precious to me than Anything In this World 🥹

I want to hold your hand, walk through our whole life with you. 🥹
I want us Celebrate every small moment and survive every storm, together. 🫠

I’m sorry I didn’t give you that from the start because i didn‘t know your value and your worth in my life. 🫠
I am very Sorry for that. 🫠
I’m sorry I caused pain to the person who gave me her everthing 🫠

I will love you through your bad days and will be your strength. 🥹
I want to remind you how beautiful you are for me and irreplaceable part of my life. 🫶🏼

When you will doubt youslef, I want to be your mirror. 🥹
To show you the stunning soul I see every time I look at you. 🥹

I’m not perfect, and i think i never will be 🫠
But my love for you is real. 🥹
I’ll carry you in my heart, in my prayers, in my dreams. 🫶🏼

From that random day, October 19th, when we first spoke 🙈
To every day after, you had been the only one I see. 🥹
And I’ll never stop choosing you. 🥹💋

If I could rewrite time, I’d go back to the moments I failed. 🫠
I wish i could go back to that time amd hold your hand tighter, listen to you more closely, and more gently.🫠

I let my moods, my ego, my carelessness get in the way of the love we had. 🫠
For that, I’ll always be sorry. 🫠

You were always the light, the soft, beautiful soul trying to love me through my flaws. 🫠
And I failed , failed to cherish you the way I should have. 🫠

You never asked for too much, you only asked for honesty, time and love. 🫠
But I gave you nothing when you gave me everything.🫠

Still, you stayed Alhamdulillah, You stayed when I was lost, When I wasn’t treating you good 🫠
I will always be sorry for that and always be thankful to you because you stayed 🫠❤️

Now without you, nothing feels right. 🫠
The time stops amd the silence became louder,
Because the one person I want to share everything with is Naraz from me 😞

And I will never stop being grateful of Allah for that first talk of us on October 19th, 2023. 🫶🏼
It was random, unplanned—but it was everything. 🫵🏻
Because through that small start, I found the person I never want to live without now Alhamdulillah. 🥹

A love that’s grown stronger because it knows how fragile hearts can be. 🌸
A love that would do anything for a second chance to make things right. 💋

Not just for me. For you. 🫶🏼
You deserve to be held like you’re the most valuable person in My life, because you are Alhamdulillah 🥹❤️

I don’t want temporary, I don’t want moments, I want forever with you, through growth, through healing, through everything.🥹

You’re not just a memory. You’re the future I dream of. 🥹
You’re not just my past. You’re the home I still belong in. 🥹

I Love You Meri Ayesha Meri Jaan Meri Motto I love you Soo much 🥹❤️

Sorry For Everything that hurted you 🫠

Happiest Birthday Mera bacha 🥹💋💋💋💋
